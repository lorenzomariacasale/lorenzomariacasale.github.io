  I supported this course through problem set and exam correction, lecture assistance, and active involvement in classroom activities. In addition, I moderated debates, delivered selected lectures during my TA sessions, and designed applied research tasks that required students to present their findings as if reporting to higher-level authorities, an approach intended to strengthen both research thinking and policy communication skills.
  <br><br>
  <strong>Lectures Delivered:</strong><br>
  • Binary Dependent Variables<br>
  • Differences-in-Differences (incl. Synthetic Controls)<br>
  • Standard Error Management<br>
  • Instrumental Variables, 2SLS, and LATE<br>
  • Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD)<br>
  • Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)
  <br><br>
  In addition to the main course, I also served as TA for the associated seminar in Spring 2024, 
  Fall 2024, and (upcoming) Fall 2025. The syllabus for Fall 2024 is available 
  <a href="/files/syl_epa_sem_fs2024.pdf">here</a>; evaluations are not available, as the seminar 
  is not formally graded.
