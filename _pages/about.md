Hi, I'm Lorenzo Maria Casale, a 4th year PhD candidate in the <a href="https://www.econ.uzh.ch/en.html">Department of Economics</a> at the University of Zurich, where I hold a scholarship from the <a href="https://www.ubscenter.uzh.ch/en/about.html">UBS Center for Economics in Society</a>. Welcome to my website!

Born and raised in Rome, I hold my Bachelor's and Master's in Economics from Tor Vergata University. I joined the PhD program in 2022 after a pre-doc with <a href="https://www.jvoth.com/">Prof. Hans-Joachim Voth</a> and <a href="https://brunocaprettini.com/">Prof. Bruno Caprettini</a>.

My research sits at the intersection of political economy and cultural economics, investigating how identity signals and expressive behavior shape political and economic outcomes. I combine causal inference with machine learning methods to study social coordination.

Current projects include: kinship networks in Italian politics and cultural expression in American high schools.
