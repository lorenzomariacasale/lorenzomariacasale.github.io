Hi, I'm Lorenzo Maria Casale, a 3rd year PhD student in Economics at the University of Zurich and a candidate for the UBS Center Scholarship 2025.

Proudly born and raised in Rome, I hold both my Bachelor and Master of Science in Economics from Tor Vergata University of Rome, specializing in Econometrics. I joined the PhD program in September 2022, after a 2-year pre-doc program in the same department with Prof. Hans-Joachim Voth, and with Prof. Bruno Caprettini (now at the University of St. Gallen).

My research sits at the intersection of political economy and cultural economics, investigating how informal institutions, identity signals, and expressive behavior shape political and economic outcomes. I combine standard causal inference techniques with tools from machine learning and AI-driven computational methods to examine how individuals convey affiliation, trustworthiness, or status, and how these signals influence patterns of social coordination.

A unifying concept across my projects is social meaning: the shared expectations and interpretations attached to visible behaviors, symbols, or cues - such as family ties, stylistic choices, or subtle gestures. 

My current work includes studying how kinship networks undermine electoral accountability in Italian municipalities, analyzing cultural expression through visual style in 20th-century America, and investigating how non-verbal cues in presidential debates predict financial market reactions.

More information about my research and CV is available on this website.
