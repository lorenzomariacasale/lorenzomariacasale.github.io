  Do family ties undermine electoral accountability? While previous studies on political accountability have examined the role of institutional factors, they often overlook the impact of social connections and familial networks in shaping politicians' behavior. We argue that politicians from large families benefit from more unconditional electoral support from their relatives, driven by loyalty and deeply ingrained social norms. As a result, their incentives to perform well are lower, as they can rely on a stable base of support regardless of their governance outcomes. Employing a TWFE and a Politician-Characteristic Regression Discontinuity (PCRD) design in 33,283 municipal elections held in Italy between 2000 and 2020, we find that mayors from larger families exhibit poorer economic performance. Using a novel dataset of mayors' CVs, we further show preliminary evidence of instances of a privatized management of public finances, with mayors from large families allocating more public funds to repair/beautify their streets of residence. Last, our analysis shows that large-family mayors are not electorally punished for their poor economic performance. Our study contributes to the literature by shedding light on the role that family networks have in shaping politicians' incentives and electoral accountability.
