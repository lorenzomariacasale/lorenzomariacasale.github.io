I'm excited to share that the paper I am jointly writing with Luca Vitale, <em>"Family Mayors: Undermined Accountability in Italian Municipalities"</em>, has been accepted for presentation at the <a href="/files/cepr_bocconi.pdf">20th Doctorissimes Conference</a>, hosted by the Paris School of Economics on April 10–11, 2025.

    It was a real pleasure to take part to the Doctorissimes Conference! Many thanks to the organizers for putting together such a stimulating event.

    We're especially grateful to <a href="https://philinew.github.io/">Philine Widmer</a> for her thoughtful and engaging discussion of my paper.
