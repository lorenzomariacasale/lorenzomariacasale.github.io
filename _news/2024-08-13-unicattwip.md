  Thanks a lot to all the people that are organizing this recurring event. Extremely useful comments and a super interested crowd, which will surely improve our paper. Special thanks to <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/federicotrombetta/home">Federico Trombetta</a> for hosting me also during the seminar day.<br><br>
