  Thanks a lot to all the people that allow me to be part of this fantastic event.

  Special thanks to all the professors who took time for sending me appropriate feedbacks, before the presentation took place, and my co-authors that gave me such possibility.

I'm excited to share that the <a href = https://www.ubscenter.uzh.ch/>UBS Center for Economics in Society</a> has chosen to allow me to present <em>"Cultural Expression and Style Preferences"</em> during the "Forum for Economic Dialogue: AI unleashed – Economic realities beyond the hype", hosted at the Careum Auditorium in Zurich on October 31, 2024.
